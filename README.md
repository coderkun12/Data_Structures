# Data Structures Repository

## Overview
This repository contains implementations of various fundamental data structures, including stacks, queues, linked lists, trees, and more. Each data structure is implemented with multiple operations, demonstrating how they work and their practical applications.

## Features
- Implementations of essential data structures.
- Code written in a structured and easy-to-understand manner.
- Well-commented programs for better readability.
- Suitable for beginners and intermediate learners.

## Data Structures Covered
### 1. Stack
- Push, Pop, Peek operations
- Implementations using arrays and linked lists

### 2. Queue
- Enqueue, Dequeue, Peek operations
- Circular Queue, Priority Queue

### 3. Linked List
- Singly Linked List
- Doubly Linked List
- Circular Linked List

### 4. Trees
- Binary Tree (Insertion, Deletion, Traversal)
- Binary Search Tree (BST)
- AVL Tree (Self-balancing BST)

## Usage
- Navigate to the respective folders for each data structure.
- Run the programs to test different operations.
- Modify or extend the implementations as needed.
